\begin{frame}{New Member Project: Competitor Analysis}
    You are starting a brand new Formula Student team,
    and you want to know which parameters are most important for performance.
    You decide to carry out a study of your competitors.
    \vspace*{2ex}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Create a database of competitors, with stats about their cars
        \item Look at how well each car performed at competition
        \item Analyse which stats have the biggest impact on performance
    \end{enumerate}
    \vspace*{2ex}
    You should look at fuel type, chassis construction, curb mass,
    maximum power, wheelbase, front and rear track width,
    aerodynamic package, suspension, and tyres.

    There is lots of information about different cars
    on team websites, Instagram, and LinkedIn.
    If you see something that looks cool or that you don't understand,
    post it on Discord in the \#susposting channel. \\
