\section*{Introduction to Laptime Simulation}

\begin{frame}{What is Laptime Simulation?}
    A Laptime Simulator (or \textbf{lapsim}) is a computer model of a vehicle that predicts how quickly the vehicle can complete a course.

    Lapsims can vary in complexity, from simple timestepping calculations in Excel through to complicated transient models or driver-in-the-loop simulations.

        As a model becomes more complex, it becomes more prone to error and harder to validate. You should always use the simplest possible model that accounts for all the behaviour you want to study.
